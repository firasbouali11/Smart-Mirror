# Smart Mirror Alexa
## Overview
The Smart Mirror Alexa project is designed to transform a standard mirror into an interactive smart mirror using a Raspberry Pi. This mirror not only provides reflection but also incorporates voice recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and face recognition to interact with users like a virtual assistant. Users can engage in verbal conversations with the mirror to perform tasks such as playing songs, scheduling appointments, checking the weather, and more.

## Features
- Voice Interaction: Interact with the mirror using natural language voice commands.
- Face Recognition: Identify signed-in users through camera-based face recognition.
- Smart Assistant Integration: Utilize Alexa for a wide range of tasks, including music playback, weather updates, and scheduling appointments.
- Color Customization: Change the color of the mirror using voice commands.
- User Interface: the mirror shows through the glass a user interface that shows you your settings, music being played, appointments, etc...
- Configuration App: Use an Alexa app to configure the mirror, add users, and manage appointments.
